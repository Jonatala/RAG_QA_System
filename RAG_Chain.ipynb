The competition has been running for ten years now, and ARU's Dr Silvia Cirstea has judged the competition.” See all Computer Science courses Read blogs from our Computer Science students What qualifications do I need to study Computer Science? Our Computer Science courses are designed to not require any specific prior knowledge or qualifications beyond A-Levels, however Mathematics and science-related subjects (Physics, Computing, etc.) would be a benefit. To study for a Computer Science BSc (Hons) at ARU you will need 104 UCAS tariff points from a minimum of 2 A Levels and 3 GCSEs at grade C, or grade 4, or above, including English and Mathematics. To study a Computer Science BEng (Hons) you will need 112 UCAS tariff points from a minimum of 2 A Levels and 3 GCSEs at grade C, or grade 4, or above, including English and Mathematics. We accept equivalent qualifications such as BTEC Level 3 Diplomas, International Baccalaureate Diploma (with a minimum of 24 points), Access to HE Diplomas, Irish Leaving Certificate, Scottish Highers and Advanced Highers, the European Baccalaureate (minimum overall grade of 60%), HND and HNC qualifications. If English is not your first language you need a certificated level of proficiency of at least IELTS 6.0 (Academic level) or\n"
